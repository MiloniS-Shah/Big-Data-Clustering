Implementation of BFR Algorithm - Bradley-Fayyad-Reina

### Dataset : 
Since the BFR algorithm has a strong assumption that the clusters are normally distributed with independent dimensions, we use a synthetic dataset by initializing some random centroids and creating some data points with the centroids and some standard deviations to form the clusters. We also add some other data points as the outliers in the dataset to evaluation the algorithm and their cluster is represented by -1. Figure below shows an example of a part of the dataset. The first column is the data point index (the first column). 
The second column is the cluster that the data point belongs to. The rest columns represent the features/dimensions of the data point.
